CarlEnergy
==========
Project Description:
A project to display energy usage and wind production at Carleton College and its buildings, using existing data maintained by the Lucid Design Group. Data for the last hour of energy usage and wind production for the entire campus is found on the Dashboard screen, and from there one can navigate to individual buildings. Information on electricity, water, and steam usage for each building for various time periods is displayed via line graphs.

Project Status:
Everything we wanted to do is pretty much done; there are a few very minor and generally hard to fix bugs here and there, and some visual improvements that could probably still be made, but the app is in a more or less completed state.

Getting Started:
Nothing special should be needed to compile and run the app.
